# Installation instructions

For this workshop you need to install Python on your laptop!

Follow the instructions below to set up your Python environment. The only requirement is that you have to do this **before** the course! Feel free to contact [Denis](mailto:d.sergeev@uea.ac.uk) if you have any problems with the installation (but better google them first!)

Note: **the course is designed in Python 3.6**, but for most cases will work in Python 3.5 too.

more coming soon...
