# Installation instructions

For this workshop you need to install Python on your laptop!

Follow the instructions below to set up your Python environment. The only requirement is that you have to do this **before** the course! Feel free to contact [Denis](mailto:d.sergeev@uea.ac.uk) if you have any problems with the installation (but better google them first!)

Note: **the course is designed in Python 3.6**, but for most cases will work in Python 3.5 too.

## 1. Install Python distribution using Anaconda

1.1 [Download Anaconda with Python 3.6 for your OS](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

1.2 Make sure it works: type `python` in terminal (**Linux / OSX**) and make sure Python 3.6 prompt appears. On **Windows** open *Anaconda Prompt* in the start menu and check if launches without errors.


## 2. Download course materials
Coming soon...


## Still having troubles?
If you are unable to install Anaconda Python 3.6 on your PC, contact the [course organisers](index.md#registration-and-enquiries).
Another option: launch the course in a cloud! [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/ueapy/pythoncourse2018-materials)
